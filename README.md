# Data Management and Visualization Application with NODE-RED

![App Demo](link_to_your_demo_screenshot_or_gif)

## Introduction

This project is a versatile application built using NODE-RED that allows users to interact with a MySQL database, enabling functionalities such as data upload, update, deletion, sorting, and visualization. Additionally, it extends its capabilities to industrial environments, enabling seamless integration with machines and control systems like PLCs for data collection, control, filtering, and analysis.

The application simplifies the process of managing and analyzing data from MySQL databases, making it accessible to a wider range of users including both individuals and industrial settings.

## Features

- **Data Management:** Upload, update, and delete data in the MySQL database through a user-friendly interface.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize database contents using interactive charts, graphs, and tables for better insights.
- **Sorting and Filtering:** Sort and filter data based on various parameters to quickly find relevant information.
- **Industrial Integration:** Connect to industrial machines and control systems like PLCs for real-time data collection and control.
- **Customization:** Easily configure and adapt the application to fit specific industrial needs and data sources.
